    <p><b>Big Ideas</b> <br>
        Working with others helps you solve problems and inspire each other. <br>
        You will be a better web designer if you get to know the modern web. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Task:</b> Explore the Modern Web <br>
        You may remember a similar assignment if you took CST251. This time you will be focusing on functionality and interactivity, the part of the web that interacts with the user. <br>
        <br>
        You will explore a dozen interesting cutting edge websites, and pick three websites that are doing something new or interesting that you want to understand. 
        <br>
        Go to <a id="awwwards" href="https://www.awwwards.com/collections/" target="_blank">awwwards.com</a> or another collection of well-designed sites. <br>
        Explore at least a dozen different websites in whatever categories strike your fancy. <br>
        Note that you have to visit the actual website by clicking the  symbol <br>
        Pick at least three websites from your explorations that are doing something interesting with interactivity that you'd like to know how to do <br>
        For each site, describe the feature you are interested in detail. Include screenshots. <br>
        Make a guess as to how you think the feature might be implemented, being as specific as you can <br>
        <br>
        <b>Deliverables</b> <br>
        In this course, everything you turn in will be professional-level communication. This is a good habit to develop. That means everything has a title page, heading to separate different sections and ideas, and clear large images and diagrams that are all carefully captioned. Any code in your assignment should use clear and neat code formatting. I suggest you use Google Docs, start with a good report template, and export to a PDF. You can also use Word, Pages, or Acrobat. Outside of school, the ability to communicate your ideas clearly is as least as important as mastery of the technical aspects of your work. <br>
        <br>
        The summary of efforts portion of each lab will be an important part of the assignment where you tell about your experience performing the lab, describe any problems you had, solutions you developed, and epiphanies you experienced. <br>
