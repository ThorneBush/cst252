        <b>Big Idea </b><br>
        With a partner, create a basic HTML file and a CSS style file, edit it, view it in your browser, and inspect it. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Task 1:</b> Create a Local File Structure <br>
        If you followed the directions for InstallFest, you already have a template for your file structure. It should look something like <br>
        <br>
        <b>Task 2:</b> Using a Text Editor <br>
        Atom is a text editor, a program that edits plain text files (unlike a word processor like Word) and is free. You should already have installed it. It is okay if you use Sublime3, Brackets, NotePad++, TextEdit, Vim, Emacs, or another text editor, but I won't be able to support you if you have problems. <br>
        <br>
        You can customize Atom and add plugins. It is very powerful. If there is something you'd like it to do, google to see if someone can guide you.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Task 3:</b> Make an HTML file and a CSS file <br>
        Work side-by-side with your partner, or use Teletype if you are working remotely with your partner. Create a basic HTML that follows these basic instructions: <br>
        <br>
        Add a box that has a background color and a border (you choose the colors and styles!) <br>
        Add two pieces of text that each have different positions, colors, and font styles (colors, font types, font weights, you name it!) <br>
    </p>
